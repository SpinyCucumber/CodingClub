Hello!
As you can most plainly see, I have started a GitHub repository so that we can share our ideas
and work most easily. If you don't already know how to use GitHub, I highly recommend you begin
to familiarize yourself with it. It really does make work like this so much easier.
As of this file, it will contain the contributors' names, the version, and any other 
information we might feel necessary to include.
