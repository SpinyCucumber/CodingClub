Coding Club Collaborative Project, 2014

Hello!
As you can most plainly see, I have started a GitHub repository so that we can share our ideas
and work most easily. If you don't already know how to use GitHub, I highly recommend you begin
to familiarize yourself with it. It really does make work like this much easier.
As of this file, it will contain the contributors' names, the version, and any other 
information we might feel necessary to include.

I plan us all to be able to make whatever contributions we think would be our next step, and allow others to build upon our ideas. I've already started developing for the game, hoping someone will adopt an idea of mine and take it to the next level.
